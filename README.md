# Python Examples from Introduction to Functional Programming

This repo contains examples from one of my favorite FP books, [Introduction to Functional Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Prentice-International/dp/0134841972) by Richard Bird and Philip Wadler. I've translated the examples as faithfully as I could from Miranda to Python + mypy.

## Install the dependencies

`poetry install`

## Run the tests

`poetry run pytest`
